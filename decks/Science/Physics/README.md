# Physics be 

Izaan is doing physics part time as i beleive no one is maintaineing it

Since physics is more of a "mathy" subject the flashcards will mostlly container equations and  the units . There will also be 3 examples on how we use those equations. I will also put concepts as well (e.g requuired practicals ,laws etc)
